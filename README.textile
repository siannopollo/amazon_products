h2. Amazon Products

h3. Overview

Use this library if you want to pull down information (via searches or specific product lookup) about products on Amazon.

*Prerequisites*

ruby-aaws gem (can be gotten from "here":http://www.caliban.org/files/ruby/ruby-aaws-0.4.4.gem)

*Usage*

bq. require 'amazon_products'
search = AmazonProducts::Search.new('Books', 'knitting')
results = search.execute
@first_result = results.first

Then in an HTML template somewhere, assuming you wanted to use an image from one of your results

bq. <pre><img src="#{@first_result.medium_image.url}"/></pre>

The individual item lookup works about the same

bq. require 'amazon_products'
lookup = AmazonProducts::Lookup.new('0834003503', 'ISBN')
@result = lookup.execute


h3. Caveats

Right now there is only support for Books, DVDs, Music and VideoGames (those are all I need right now :-)
