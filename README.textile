h2. Amazon Products

h3. Overview

Use this library if you want to pull down information (via searches or specific product lookup) about products on Amazon.

*Prerequisites*

ruby-aaws gem (can be gotten from "here":http://www.caliban.org/files/ruby/ruby-aaws-0.4.4.gem)

You will need an AWS "access key ID":https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html. The location of this will need to be configured much like what is shown below.

*Usage*

The yaml file containing your access_key_id should look something like this:

<pre>access_key_id: your-key-here</pre>

There is no default location for the config file, so you _must_ supply the location somewhere in your app like so:

<pre>AmazonProducts.config_location = 'config/amazon.yml'</pre>

You can search for products like this:

<pre>
  require 'amazon_products'
  search = AmazonProducts::Search.new('Books', 'knitting')
  results = search.execute
  @first_result = results.first
</pre>

Then in an HTML template somewhere, assuming you wanted to use an image from one of your results:

<pre><img src="#{@first_result.medium_image.url}"/></pre>

The individual item lookup works about the same:

<pre>
require 'amazon_products'
lookup = AmazonProducts::Lookup.new('0834003503', 'ISBN')
@result = lookup.execute
</pre>


h3. Caveats

Right now there is only support for Books, DVDs, Music and VideoGames (those are all I need right now :-)
